# QtUtils

QtUtils is a collection of useful cross-platform classes for Qt framework. The code is tested only under Qt5 and may not work with Qt4. To keep it simple and lean, there is no need to build QtUtils. Just include the classes you want to use in your source code directly. Examples can be build using either Visual Studio on Windows or using qmake on all supported platforms.

Following is the list of all classes present.
